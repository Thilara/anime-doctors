## Quick Start

#### Create a Gatsby site

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the Lumen starter.

```sh
# Create a new Gatsby site using the  gatsby-starter-volunteers
gatsby new volunteers https://github.com/rmagon/gatsby-starter-volunteers
```

#### Start Developing

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

```sh
cd volunteers
gatsby develop
```

#### Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

#### To add more schedules
1. Open the `data` directory in your code editor of choice.
2. Edit `schedules.json` and add a new element.
3. Save your changes.
+ Note: The schedule will only appear when we use the same `questionId` in one of the volunteers

#### To add more volunteers
1. Open the `data/volunteers` directory in your code editor of choice.
2. Add another file, like the existing voluntary files eg: `jean-jollet.json`
3. Save your changes.
4. The voluntary will appear on your homepage at `http://localhost:8000`!

## Deploy with Netlify

The project can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with Netlify. Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/rmagon/gatsby-starter-volunteers" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

1. After clicking that button, you’ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name.
2. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template.
3. It will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete.
